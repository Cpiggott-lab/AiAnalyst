## ü§ñ How AI Is Used

- On upload, a prompt is sent to OpenAI with a preview of your dataset.
- An executive summary is generated, identifying key points and trends.
- Follow-up questions are processed via OpenAI using the same dataset context.
- Chart suggestions are returned in JSON format for use in Recharts.
